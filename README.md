# Hello World 👋 This is Yan (she/her). Yan Can Code! 
I'm a passionate full stack web developer with 4+ years of experience in the digital marketing and administration industry. Currently based in Toronto, I am pursuing my Web Development studies at Humber right now, with a Bachelor's degree in Social Science with a major in Journalism and Communication.

My journey in web development has been driven by a dedication to creating top-notch web solutions and effectively managing projects. I enjoy building websites from scratch, infusing them with customised elements that enhance the user experience.

Transitioning into web development wasn't an easy path, but it has been an incredibly interesting and rewarding one. I thrive on the challenges it brings and the constant opportunity to learn and grow in this dynamic field.
